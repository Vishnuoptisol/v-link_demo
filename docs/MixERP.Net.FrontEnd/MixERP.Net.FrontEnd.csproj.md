# MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.csproj.user Documentation

## Overview

The `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.csproj.user` file is a user-specific Visual Studio project settings file for the [MixERP.Net.FrontEnd](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.csproj.md) ASP.NET project. This file contains user-specific configurations that aren't typically shared in version control and stores personal developer preferences and debugging settings for the project.

## File Structure

### PropertyGroup Section

The `PropertyGroup` section contains user-specific project properties:

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| ProjectView | ProjectFiles | Sets the default view mode in Visual Studio's Solution Explorer to show files organized by their physical file structure rather than logical folders. |
| NameOfLastUsedPublishProfile | MixERP | References the last deployment profile used to publish the project, pointing to the [MixERP.pubxml](Properties/PublishProfiles/MixERP.pubxml.md) profile. |

### ProjectExtensions Section

The `ProjectExtensions` section contains Visual Studio-specific extensions and settings:

#### FlavorProperties

These settings define how the web project behaves during debugging sessions:

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| GUID | {349c5851-65df-11da-9384-00065b846f21} | The standard GUID identifier for ASP.NET web projects in Visual Studio. |

#### WebProjectProperties

These properties control the debugging experience for the ASP.NET web application:

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| StartPageUrl | (empty) | No specific start page is defined, so debugging will begin at the application's default page. |
| StartAction | CurrentPage | When debugging begins, Visual Studio will use the currently open page as the start page. |
| AspNetDebugging | True | ASP.NET debugging is enabled, allowing breakpoints in server-side code. |
| SilverlightDebugging | False | Silverlight debugging is disabled. |
| NativeDebugging | False | Native code debugging is disabled. |
| SQLDebugging | False | SQL debugging is disabled. |
| ExternalProgram | (empty) | No external program is configured to launch during debugging. |
| StartExternalURL | (empty) | No external URL is configured as the starting point. |
| StartCmdLineArguments | (empty) | No command line arguments are passed when debugging starts. |
| StartWorkingDirectory | (empty) | No specific working directory is set for debugging. |
| EnableENC | False | Edit and Continue functionality is disabled. |
| AlwaysStartWebServerOnDebug | True | The web server will always be started when debugging begins. |

## Usage Context

This file is automatically generated and modified by Visual Studio when developers change project settings or debugging configurations. It works in conjunction with the main [MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.csproj](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.csproj.md) file but contains only user-specific settings that shouldn't be shared across development environments.

The publish profile referenced in this file (`MixERP`) corresponds to the deployment settings defined in [MixERP.pubxml](Properties/PublishProfiles/MixERP.pubxml.md), which contains the configuration used when publishing the application to a server.

This file is typically excluded from version control in a `.gitignore` file to prevent conflicts between different developers' environments.
