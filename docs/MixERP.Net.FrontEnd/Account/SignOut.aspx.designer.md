# SignOut.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview
This file is an auto-generated designer code for the `SignOut.aspx` page in the MixERP.Net FrontEnd application. It belongs to the account management section and defines the partial class `SignOut` with UI control declarations. The designer file works in conjunction with the [SignOut.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/SignOut.aspx.md) page and its code-behind file [SignOut.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/SignOut.aspx.cs.md) to handle user sign-out functionality.

## Class Documentation

### `SignOut` Class
- **Namespace**: `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.Account`
- **Access Modifier**: `public`
- **Type**: `partial class` 
- **Purpose**: Represents the designer code for the Sign Out page that defines the UI controls.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `Content1` | `System.Web.UI.WebControls.Content` | Represents a content control that is defined in the SignOut.aspx page and mapped to a content placeholder in the master page. |

## Notes
- This file is auto-generated by the ASP.NET designer tooling and should not be manually modified.
- The `partial` keyword indicates that this class is part of a larger class definition split across multiple files, with the main implementation likely found in [SignOut.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/SignOut.aspx.cs.md).
- The class contains UI control definitions that are used in the SignOut page to manage the sign-out process.
- Changes made directly to this file will be lost when the designer regenerates the code.
- This file works with the [ContentMaster.Master](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/ContentMaster.Master.md) or another master page that defines the content placeholders.

## Related Files
- [SignOut.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/SignOut.aspx.md) - The ASPX markup file for the Sign Out page
- [SignOut.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/SignOut.aspx.cs.md) - The code-behind file containing the implementation logic
- [MixERPMaster.Master](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/MixERPMaster.Master.md) - The likely master page for this application
- [ContentMaster.Master](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/ContentMaster.Master.md) - A possible alternative master page used in the application

## Technical Implementation
The auto-generated `Content1` control is likely mapped to a ContentPlaceHolder in a master page, and the actual sign-out functionality would be implemented in the code-behind file [SignOut.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/SignOut.aspx.cs.md).
