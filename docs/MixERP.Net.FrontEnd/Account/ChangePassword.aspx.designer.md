# ChangePassword.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview
This file is an auto-generated designer code file for the `ChangePassword` web form in the MixERP.Net application. It contains the declarations of controls that are defined in the associated ASPX file [ChangePassword.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/ChangePassword.aspx.md). This file is automatically generated by Visual Studio's ASP.NET Web Forms designer and should not be modified manually.

## Class Documentation

### ChangePassword
This partial class represents the design-time information for the Change Password functionality in the MixERP.Net application.

**Access Modifier**: `public`

**Namespace**: `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.Account`

**Type**: Partial class

**Base Class**: Implicit inheritance from `System.Web.UI.Page` (typical for ASP.NET Web Forms)

### Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `Content1` | `System.Web.UI.WebControls.Content` | Represents a content control that will be placed in a content placeholder in the master page. This control likely contains the password change form elements. |

## Related Files
- [ChangePassword.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/ChangePassword.aspx.md) - The actual ASPX markup file that contains the user interface for the password change functionality.
- [ChangePassword.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/ChangePassword.aspx.cs.md) - The code-behind file containing the business logic for the password change functionality.

## Notes
1. The file is marked as auto-generated by a tool (Visual Studio), with runtime version 4.0.30319.18033.
2. Changes made directly to this file will be lost if the designer file is regenerated.
3. The actual implementation of the password change functionality would be found in the code-behind file [ChangePassword.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Account/ChangePassword.aspx.cs.md).
4. This class is defined as `partial` which means its implementation may be split across multiple files. The main implementation is likely in the code-behind file.
5. The class may use the master page defined in [MixERPMaster.Master](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/MixERPMaster.Master.md) or another master page in the project.

## Usage Example
This being a designer file, it is not directly used in code. Instead, it provides declarations for controls that are referenced in the code-behind file. The ASP.NET runtime uses these declarations to establish the connection between the ASPX markup and the code-behind logic.
