# Labels.resx Documentation

## Overview

The file `Labels.resx` is a resource file in the MixERP.Net.FrontEnd project that contains localized string resources used across the application. These resources provide standardized text for various UI elements, messages, notifications, and instructions. The file follows the Microsoft ResX Schema version 2.0 format, which is an XML-based resource file format used in .NET applications for storing resources such as strings, images, and other serializable objects.

This resource file specifically contains labels and messages that are used to maintain consistent user interface text throughout the application. It serves as a centralized location for string resources, which facilitates localization and maintenance of the application's textual content.

## Resource Structure

The `Labels.resx` file is structured as a standard .NET resource file with `<data>` elements containing key-value pairs. Each resource entry has a unique name (key) and a corresponding value (the localized text).

### Resource Headers

- **resmimetype**: text/microsoft-resx
- **version**: 2.0
- **reader**: System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089

### Resource Entries

Here is a detailed description of each resource entry in the file:

| Name | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| FieldRequired | This field is required. | Used to indicate that a form field must be filled out. |
| Loading | Loading ... | Displayed during loading operations or data retrieval. |
| NothingSelected | Nothing selected. | Indicates that no item has been selected from a list or dropdown. |
| PartyDescription | Parties collectively refer to suppliers, customers, agents, and dealers. | Description of what constitutes a "party" in the system context. |
| RequiredFieldDetails | The fields marked with asterisk (*) are required. | Instruction for users about required fields on forms. |
| TaskCompletedSuccessfully | The task was completed successfully. | Success message displayed after operations complete without errors. |
| TransactionWithdrawnMessage | The transaction was withdrawn successfully. Moreover, this action will affect the all the reports produced on and after "{0}". | Message shown after a transaction is withdrawn, with a placeholder for the date from which reports will be affected. |
| VerificationApprovedMessage | This transaction was approved by {0} on {1}. | Message showing that a transaction has been approved, with placeholders for the approver's name and date. |
| VerificationAwaitingMessage | This transaction is awaiting verification from an administrator. | Indicates that a transaction needs administrative verification. |
| VerificationClosedMessage | This transaction was closed by {0} on {1}. Reason: "{2}". | Message shown when a transaction is closed, with placeholders for the closer's name, date, and reason. |
| VerificationRejectedMessage | This transaction was rejected by {0} on {1}. Reason: "{2}". | Message shown when a transaction is rejected, with placeholders for the rejector's name, date, and reason. |
| VerificationWithdrawnMessage | This transaction was withdrawn by {0} on {1}. Reason: "{2}". | Message shown when a transaction is withdrawn, with placeholders for the withdrawer's name, date, and reason. |

## Usage in the Application

These resource strings are used throughout the MixERP.Net.FrontEnd project in various pages and controls. They can be accessed programmatically in code-behind files using the `Resources` class generated from this resource file. For example:

```csharp
// Example usage in a C# code-behind file
string message = Resources.Labels.TaskCompletedSuccessfully;
```

### Related Files

The Labels.resx file is part of the App_GlobalResources directory which contains several other resource files:

- [FormResource.resx](./FormResource.md) - Contains form-related resources
- [Questions.resx](./Questions.md) - Contains question prompts
- [Setup.resx](./Setup.md) - Contains setup-related text resources
- [Titles.resx](./Titles.md) - Contains page and section titles
- [Warnings.resx](./Warnings.md) - Contains warning messages

A corresponding auto-generated [Labels.Designer.cs](./Labels.Designer.cs.md) file provides strongly-typed access to these resources.

## Localization

This resource file serves as the default (invariant) culture resource file. For localization to other languages, corresponding resource files would be created with the culture suffix (e.g., `Labels.fr.resx` for French).

## Placeholder Usage

Several messages in this file use placeholders (denoted by `{0}`, `{1}`, etc.), which are replaced at runtime with dynamic content using string formatting methods such as `String.Format()`. For example:

- In `TransactionWithdrawnMessage`, the `{0}` placeholder would be replaced with a date.
- In `VerificationApprovedMessage`, the `{0}` and `{1}` placeholders would be replaced with an approver's name and date.

## Integration with UI Controls

These label resources are typically used in various UI controls such as:

- Form validation messages
- Notification displays
- Status indicators
- Information tooltips
- Transaction status messages

The centralized approach to managing these strings makes it easier to maintain consistent wording and facilitate translations across the entire application.
