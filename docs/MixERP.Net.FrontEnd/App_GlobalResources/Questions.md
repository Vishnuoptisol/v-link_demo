# Questions.resx Documentation

## Overview

`Questions.resx` is a resource file in the MixERP.Net.FrontEnd application that contains text strings related to various confirmation prompts and questions displayed to users throughout the application. These resources are used to provide consistent, potentially localizable message text for confirmation dialogs, security questions, and other user interaction prompts.

The file is part of the application's globalization infrastructure and follows the Microsoft .NET Resource File (RESX) format. It belongs to the `App_GlobalResources` directory, which typically contains shared resources that can be used across the entire application.

## Resource File Structure

This RESX file follows the standard .NET resource file structure with:

- XML schema definition
- Resource header information
- Data elements containing string values

## Resource Entries

The following string resources are defined in this file:

| Resource Name | Value | Purpose |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| AreYouSure | Are you sure? | Generic confirmation prompt used throughout the application |
| CantAccessAccount | Can't access your account? | Used in authentication-related screens, likely for account recovery |
| ConfirmAnalyze | This will lock client database access during execution. Are you sure you want to execute this action right now? | Warning displayed before executing database analysis operations |
| ConfirmVacuum | This will lock client database access during execution. Are you sure you want to execute this action right now? | Warning displayed before executing database vacuum operations |
| ConfirmVacuumFull | This will lock client database access during execution. Are you sure you want to execute this action right now? | Warning displayed before executing full database vacuum operations |
| UpdateTax | Update tax? | Confirmation prompt for tax update operations |

## Usage in Application

These resource strings are likely accessed through the `Questions` class, which is automatically generated by Visual Studio from this RESX file (as defined in [Questions.Designer.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/App_GlobalResources/Questions.Designer.cs)).

The resources are typically used in:

1. JavaScript confirmation dialogs
2. Server-side validation messages
3. UI elements requiring user confirmation before performing potentially disruptive operations

### Example Usage

In ASP.NET pages or user controls, these resources might be accessed like:

```csharp
// In server-side code
string confirmMessage = Questions.AreYouSure;

// In client-side JavaScript (via embedded resource)
var message = '<%= Questions.AreYouSure %>';
if(confirm(message)) {
    // Perform action
}
```

## Localization

As a RESX file, this resource can be localized by creating culture-specific versions of the file (e.g., `Questions.fr.resx` for French). The appropriate resource file is then loaded based on the user's culture settings.
