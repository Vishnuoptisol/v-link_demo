# Titles.Designer.cs Documentation

## Overview

`Titles.Designer.cs` is an auto-generated resource file that provides strongly-typed access to localized string resources. This file is part of the MixERP.Net.FrontEnd application and belongs to the App_GlobalResources folder. It contains title text strings used across the application for consistent labeling of UI elements like buttons, headings, and form fields.

The file is generated by the StronglyTypedResourceBuilder tool from a corresponding `Titles.resx` resource file, which is found in the same directory ([App_GlobalResources/Titles.resx](../App_GlobalResources/Titles.resx)). Since it's auto-generated, manual changes to this file will be overwritten when the resource file is recompiled.

## Class Documentation

### Titles

```csharp
[global::System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.Application.StronglyTypedResourceProxyBuilder", "11.0.0.0")]
[global::System.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute()]
[global::System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CompilerGeneratedAttribute()]
internal class Titles
```

**Purpose:** Provides strongly-typed access to localized string resources for titles and labels used throughout the MixERP application.

**Access Modifier:** `internal` - The class is accessible only within the assembly.

**Attributes:**
- `GeneratedCodeAttribute` - Indicates this code was auto-generated
- `DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute` - Instructs the debugger to skip this code when debugging
- `CompilerGeneratedAttribute` - Indicates this code was generated by the compiler

### Fields

```csharp
private static global::System.Resources.ResourceManager resourceMan;
private static global::System.Globalization.CultureInfo resourceCulture;
```

- `resourceMan`: Static field that holds the ResourceManager instance
- `resourceCulture`: Static field that stores the current culture information for resource lookups

### Constructor

```csharp
[global::System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("Microsoft.Performance", "CA1811:AvoidUncalledPrivateCode")]
internal Titles()
```

**Purpose:** Default constructor for the Titles class. 

**Access Modifier:** `internal` - The constructor is only accessible within the assembly.

**Attributes:**
- `SuppressMessageAttribute` - Suppresses the warning about this being an uncalled private code, which is expected for auto-generated resource classes.

### Properties

#### ResourceManager

```csharp
[global::System.ComponentModel.EditorBrowsableAttribute(global::System.ComponentModel.EditorBrowsableState.Advanced)]
internal static global::System.Resources.ResourceManager ResourceManager
```

**Purpose:** Returns the cached ResourceManager instance used by this class.

**Access Modifier:** `internal static` - The property is accessible only within the assembly and is static.

**Return Type:** `global::System.Resources.ResourceManager`

**Implementation:** Checks if `resourceMan` is null, and if so, initializes it with a new ResourceManager that loads resources from "Resources.Titles" in the App_GlobalResources assembly.

**Attributes:**
- `EditorBrowsableAttribute` - Indicates this property should only be visible to advanced users in editors.

#### Culture

```csharp
[global::System.ComponentModel.EditorBrowsableAttribute(global::System.ComponentModel.EditorBrowsableState.Advanced)]
internal static global::System.Globalization.CultureInfo Culture
```

**Purpose:** Gets or sets the culture for the current thread, affecting how resources are loaded.

**Access Modifier:** `internal static` - The property is accessible only within the assembly and is static.

**Type:** `global::System.Globalization.CultureInfo`

**Implementation:** Simple getter and setter for the `resourceCulture` field.

**Attributes:**
- `EditorBrowsableAttribute` - Indicates this property should only be visible to advanced users in editors.

### Resource String Properties

The class contains numerous static properties that return localized string resources. Each property follows this pattern:

```csharp
/// <summary>
///   Looks up a localized string similar to [example text].
/// </summary>
internal static string ResourceName {
    get {
        return ResourceManager.GetString("ResourceName", resourceCulture);
    }
}
```

These properties retrieve localized strings from the resource file based on the resource name and current culture. Some examples include:

- `Account`: Returns "Account" text
- `AccountCode`: Returns "Account Code" text
- `Action`: Returns "Action" text
- `Add`: Returns "Add" text
- `AddNew`: Returns "Add New" text
- `AddNewEntry`: Returns "Add a New Entry" text

And many more, covering a wide range of UI labels used across the application, such as:
- Button labels (`Save`, `Print`, `Cancel`, etc.)
- Form field labels (`CustomerName`, `Email`, `Password`, etc.)
- Page titles (`ChartOfAccounts`, `DatabaseStatistics`, etc.)
- Transaction-related labels (`Invoice`, `DeliveryNote`, `PurchaseOrder`, etc.)

## Usage Examples

While not directly instantiated (as it's a resource class), the Titles class is used throughout the application to provide localized text. For example:

```csharp
// In a form or page:
lblAccount.Text = Resources.Titles.Account;
btnSave.Text = Resources.Titles.Save;
pageTitle.Text = Resources.Titles.ChartOfAccounts;
```

This ensures consistent text labels throughout the application and supports localization.

## Notes

- This is an auto-generated file that should not be manually modified.
- Changes should be made to the corresponding .resx file and then this file will be regenerated.
- The class provides strongly-typed access to localized strings, making it easier to use them in the application code.
- Resource manager handles localization based on the current culture.
