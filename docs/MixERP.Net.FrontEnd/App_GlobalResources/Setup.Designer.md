# Setup.Designer.cs Documentation

## Overview

`Setup.Designer.cs` is an auto-generated resource class file located in the `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd\App_GlobalResources` directory. It was generated by the StronglyTypedResourceBuilder tool and serves as a strongly-typed resource class for accessing localized strings and other resources in the MixERP.Net application. This class provides access to the resources defined in the corresponding `Setup.resx` file, making localization management more structured and type-safe.

## Class Documentation

### Setup

```csharp
internal class Setup
```

**Purpose**: This class provides strongly-typed access to resources defined in the `Setup.resx` file, facilitating localization in the application.

**Access Modifier**: `internal` - The class is accessible only within the assembly.

**Attributes**:
- `private static global::System.Resources.ResourceManager resourceMan`: Caches the ResourceManager instance.
- `private static global::System.Globalization.CultureInfo resourceCulture`: Stores the current culture for resource lookup.

### Constructor

```csharp
internal Setup()
```

**Access Modifier**: `internal`

**Purpose**: Default constructor for the Setup class.

**Notes**: This constructor is marked with `[SuppressMessage("Microsoft.Performance", "CA1811:AvoidUncalledPrivateCode")]` to suppress code analysis warnings about it being uncalled. This is typical for resource classes, as they are primarily used through their static members.

## Properties

### ResourceManager

```csharp
internal static global::System.Resources.ResourceManager ResourceManager { get; }
```

**Access Modifier**: `internal static`

**Type**: `global::System.Resources.ResourceManager`

**Purpose**: Returns the cached ResourceManager instance used by this class. It provides access to the resources contained in the corresponding .resx file.

**Behavior**:
1. Checks if the `resourceMan` instance is null
2. If null, creates a new ResourceManager instance pointing to "Resources.Setup" in the "App_GlobalResources" assembly
3. Caches and returns this instance

**EditorBrowsable**: Marked with `EditorBrowsableState.Advanced` to indicate it's an advanced property that should be hidden in IntelliSense unless advanced features are enabled.

### Culture

```csharp
internal static global::System.Globalization.CultureInfo Culture { get; set; }
```

**Access Modifier**: `internal static`

**Type**: `global::System.Globalization.CultureInfo`

**Purpose**: Gets or sets the culture used for resource lookups. By changing this property, resources can be retrieved according to a specific culture rather than the default culture of the thread.

**EditorBrowsable**: Marked with `EditorBrowsableState.Advanced` to indicate it's an advanced property.

### RequiredFieldIndicator

```csharp
internal static string RequiredFieldIndicator { get; }
```

**Access Modifier**: `internal static`

**Type**: `string`

**Purpose**: Gets a localized string resource that represents a required field indicator (appears to be " *" from the comment).

**Behavior**: Retrieves the string resource named "RequiredFieldIndicator" from the resource file using the current Culture setting.

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Getting the required field indicator
string indicator = Resources.Setup.RequiredFieldIndicator;

// Use this indicator in UI elements to mark required fields
Label requiredLabel = new Label();
requiredLabel.Text = "Username" + indicator;
```

## Resource File

The actual resource strings are stored in the companion file [Setup.resx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/App_GlobalResources/Setup.resx), which contains key-value pairs for all localized strings used in the setup portions of the application. This .resx file is used to generate this strongly-typed resource class.

## Notes

1. This is an auto-generated file. Manual changes to this file will be overwritten if the code is regenerated.
2. To add or modify resources, edit the `Setup.resx` file and then either:
   - Rerun ResGen with the /str option
   - Rebuild the Visual Studio project
3. The class uses advanced .NET localization features to support internationalization in the MixERP.Net application.
