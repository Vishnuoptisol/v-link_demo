# Lead.aspx.cs Documentation

## Overview

`Lead.aspx.cs` is a code-behind file for the Lead management page in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) module of MixERP.Net. This file defines the server-side logic for the Lead.aspx page. It inherits from the `MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass`, providing it with common functionality used across MixERP pages.

The file handles the basic page lifecycle events, particularly the `Page_Load` event, which is triggered when the page loads in the browser. In the current implementation, this event handler is empty, suggesting that either:
1. The Lead management page is primarily client-side driven
2. The implementation is still in progress
3. The actual logic is handled in the base class or through other mechanisms

## Class Documentation

### Lead

- **Namespace**: `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM`
- **Access Modifier**: `public`
- **Inheritance**: Inherits from `MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass`
- **Partial**: This is marked as a `partial` class, meaning its implementation could be split across multiple files

#### Purpose
The `Lead` class serves as the code-behind for the Lead management page in the CRM module. It would typically handle server-side events, data binding, and other functionality specific to lead management.

#### Related Files
- [Lead.aspx](Lead.aspx) - The associated ASP.NET Web Form
- [Lead.aspx.designer.cs](Lead.aspx.designer.cs) - The designer file containing declarations of controls used in the page

## Method Documentation

### Page_Load

- **Access Modifier**: `protected`
- **Return Type**: `void`
- **Parameters**:
  - `object sender`: The object that triggered the event
  - `EventArgs e`: Contains event data

#### Description
The `Page_Load` event handler is called when the page is loaded. In this implementation, the method body is empty, suggesting that no specific initialization is currently needed when the page loads.

#### Usage Example
While the method is currently empty, it could be extended to include initialization code, such as:

```csharp
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
        // Initialize page controls
        LoadLeadData();
    }
}
```
