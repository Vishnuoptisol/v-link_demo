# Lead.aspx Documentation

## Overview

`Lead.aspx` is an ASP.NET Web Form page that belongs to the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) module of the MixERP.Net application. This page is designed to manage lead information as part of the CRM functionality. The page inherits from the [ContentMaster.Master](../ContentMaster.Master.md) master page, which provides the common layout and structure shared across the application.

This page appears to be a placeholder or template file as it contains the basic structure of a content page but no implementation details within the content placeholders. The actual functionality and UI elements would be implemented in the corresponding code-behind file [Lead.aspx.cs](./Lead.aspx.cs.md).

## Page Structure

### Master Page

- **Master Page File**: [ContentMaster.Master](../ContentMaster.Master.md)
- **Auto Event Wireup**: Enabled
- **Code Behind File**: [Lead.aspx.cs](./Lead.aspx.cs.md)
- **Inherits Class**: `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM.Lead`

### Content Placeholders

The page defines four content areas that map to placeholders in the master page:

1. **ScriptContentPlaceHolder** (Content1)
   - Purpose: For JavaScript code and references
   - Current Implementation: Empty

2. **StyleSheetContentPlaceHolder** (Content2)
   - Purpose: For CSS stylesheets and inline styles
   - Current Implementation: Empty

3. **BodyContentPlaceHolder** (Content3)
   - Purpose: Main content area for the page
   - Current Implementation: Empty

4. **BottomScriptContentPlaceHolder** (Content4)
   - Purpose: For JavaScript that needs to be loaded after the page content
   - Current Implementation: Empty

## Technical Notes

Since this is an ASP.NET Web Form (.aspx) file, the primary UI elements, form controls, and business logic would typically be defined in:

1. The code-behind file [Lead.aspx.cs](./Lead.aspx.cs.md)
2. Possibly in user controls that might be included within this page
3. Through data-binding to models defined elsewhere in the application

Without further implementation details in the content placeholders, this appears to be either a placeholder file awaiting implementation or a file that relies heavily on its code-behind for dynamic content generation.
