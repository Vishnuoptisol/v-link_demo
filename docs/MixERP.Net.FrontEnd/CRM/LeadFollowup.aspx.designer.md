# LeadFollowup.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview
`LeadFollowup.aspx.designer.cs` is an auto-generated file that defines the designer class for the `LeadFollowup` web form in the MixERP.Net CRM module. This file contains declarations of controls that are defined in the corresponding [LeadFollowup.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/LeadFollowup.aspx.md) file. It's part of the ASP.NET Web Forms designer infrastructure, where the designer file maintains the references to controls that can be accessed programmatically in the [LeadFollowup.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/LeadFollowup.aspx.cs.md) code-behind file.
