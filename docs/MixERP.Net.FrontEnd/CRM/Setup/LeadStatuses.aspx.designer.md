# LeadStatuses.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview

`LeadStatuses.aspx.designer.cs` is an auto-generated designer file for the LeadStatuses web form within the MixERP.Net CRM module. This file defines the controls that are declared in the associated ASPX page. Designer files in ASP.NET are automatically generated by Visual Studio and contain declarations for controls that can be accessed programmatically in the code-behind file.

The file belongs to the CRM setup functionality of MixERP.Net, specifically handling the configuration of lead statuses used in the customer relationship management process.

## Class Documentation

### LeadStatuses

**Namespace**: `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM.Setup`  
**Access Modifier**: `public`  
**Type**: `partial class`  
**Purpose**: Represents the code-behind class for the LeadStatuses.aspx page, which is responsible for managing lead status configurations in the CRM module.

#### Fields

| Name | Type | Access Modifier | Description |
|------|------|----------------|-------------|
| LeadStatusForm | [FormControl](../UserControls/Forms/FormControl.md) | protected | A form control used to manage lead status data entry and display. This control is declared in the ASPX page and generated automatically in this designer file. |

## Dependencies

- The class uses the `FormControl` from the `[MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.UserControls.Forms]` namespace, defined in [FormControl.ascx](../UserControls/Forms/FormControl.md), which provides a standardized form interface for data entry.
- The class is associated with [LeadStatuses.aspx](../CRM/Setup/LeadStatuses.aspx) and its code-behind file [LeadStatuses.aspx.cs](../CRM/Setup/LeadStatuses.aspx.cs), which contain the implementation of the lead status management functionality.

## Additional Notes

1. This file is auto-generated by the ASP.NET designer and should not be manually modified.
2. Any changes to the control declarations should be made in the associated ASPX file instead.
3. The file contains partial class definition that is completed in the code-behind file [LeadStatuses.aspx.cs](../CRM/Setup/LeadStatuses.aspx.cs).
4. The LeadStatuses functionality is part of the CRM module's setup section, where administrators can define various status options for leads in the sales pipeline.
5. Changes to this file will be overwritten when the designer regenerates it, so customizations should be made in the code-behind file instead.
