# LeadStatuses.aspx.cs Documentation

## Overview

This file defines the `LeadStatuses` class in the `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM.Setup` namespace, which is a server-side code-behind file for the LeadStatuses.aspx web form. It's part of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) module of MixERP, specifically within the setup section for managing lead statuses. The class inherits from [`MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass`](../../../BusinessLayer/BasePageClass.md) which likely provides common functionality for all pages in the application.

## Class Documentation

### LeadStatuses

**Purpose:** Represents the code-behind class for the LeadStatuses.aspx page, which is likely used to manage (create, read, update, delete) lead statuses in the CRM module.

**Access Modifier:** `public`

**Inheritance:** Inherits from `MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass`, which provides common functionality for MixERP pages.

**Attributes:**
- `partial` - Indicates that this class is part of a partial class definition, with the other part likely being auto-generated by the ASP.NET designer.

## Method Documentation

### Page_Load

**Purpose:** Handles the page load event for the LeadStatuses.aspx page. This method is called when the page is loaded in the browser.

**Access Modifier:** `protected`

**Parameters:**
- `sender` (type: `object`): The object that triggered the event.
- `e` (type: `System.EventArgs`): Contains event data.

**Return Type:** `void` (does not return a value)

**Implementation Details:**
Currently, the method has an empty implementation, suggesting that either:
1. The page initialization logic is handled in the base class
2. No special initialization is required for this page
3. The implementation will be added in the future

**Example Usage:**
This method is automatically called by the ASP.NET page lifecycle and doesn't need to be explicitly invoked in code.

```csharp
// This method is automatically called during the page lifecycle
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Currently has no implementation
}
```
