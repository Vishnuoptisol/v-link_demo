# LeadSources.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview

This file contains the automatically generated designer code for the `LeadSources` class in the MixERP.Net CRM Setup module. The designer file defines UI controls that are used in the corresponding LeadSources.aspx page. As an auto-generated file by the ASP.NET designer tool, this code should not be manually modified as any changes will be overwritten when the designer regenerates the file.

## Class Documentation

### LeadSources

**Namespace**: `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM.Setup`  
**Access Modifier**: `public`  
**Type**: `partial class`  
**Purpose**: Represents the design component of the Lead Sources setup page in the CRM module.

## Control Documentation

### LeadSourceForm

**Type**: [FormControl](../UserControls/Forms/FormControl.md)  
**Access Modifier**: `protected`  
**Scope**: `global`  
**Purpose**: Provides the form interface for creating, viewing, editing, and managing lead sources.

This control is auto-generated by the ASP.NET designer, and as indicated in the comments, modifications should be made in the code-behind file rather than directly in this designer file to prevent changes from being lost during regeneration.

- [LeadSources.aspx.cs](LeadSources.aspx.cs) - The code-behind file that implements the functionality for this page
- [FormControl.ascx](../UserControls/Forms/FormControl.md) - The user control used for form operations in this page

## Implementation Notes

As this is an auto-generated file, developers should avoid making direct changes to it. Instead, any modifications to the behavior of the LeadSources page should be made in the corresponding code-behind file [LeadSources.aspx.cs](LeadSources.aspx.cs).

The page uses the shared [FormControl](../UserControls/Forms/FormControl.md) component which provides standardized form operations across the MixERP application, maintaining UI consistency and reducing code duplication.
