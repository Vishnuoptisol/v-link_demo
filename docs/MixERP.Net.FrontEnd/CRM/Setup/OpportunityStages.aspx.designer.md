# OpportunityStages.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview

`OpportunityStages.aspx.designer.cs` is an auto-generated file that serves as the designer code-behind for the `OpportunityStages.aspx` page within the MixERP CRM module's setup section. This file defines the controls that are available to the code-behind class (`OpportunityStages.aspx.cs`). Auto-generated designer files in ASP.NET are created and maintained by Visual Studio's design tools and should not be manually edited as indicated by the file's header comment.

## Class Documentation

### OpportunityStages

**Namespace:** `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM.Setup`

**Access Modifier:** `public`

**Type:** `partial class`

**Purpose:** Represents the code-behind class for the OpportunityStages.aspx page. This partial class contains designer-generated code that defines the web controls available on the page. The class is marked as `partial`, which means the actual implementation logic is contained in a separate file ([OpportunityStages.aspx.cs](OpportunityStages.aspx.cs)).

## Properties/Fields

### OpportunityStageForm

**Access Modifier:** `protected`

**Type:** `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.UserControls.Forms.FormControl`

**Purpose:** Represents a form control used for managing opportunity stages in the CRM module. This control is defined in [FormControl.ascx](../../UserControls/Forms/FormControl.ascx) and provides standardized form functionality.

**Scope:** This field is globally accessible within the `OpportunityStages` class.

**Remarks:** Auto-generated field. The actual declaration and initialization of this control is managed by the ASP.NET runtime based on the markup in the corresponding ASPX file. To modify this control, changes should be made in the ASPX file rather than directly in this designer file.

## Dependencies

- [UserControls/Forms/FormControl.ascx](../../UserControls/Forms/FormControl.ascx) - The user control that provides form functionality for managing opportunity stages.
- [CRM/Setup/OpportunityStages.aspx.cs](OpportunityStages.aspx.cs) - The code-behind implementation file that contains the business logic for this page.
- [CRM/Setup/OpportunityStages.aspx](OpportunityStages.aspx) - The ASPX markup file that defines the UI for this page.

## Notes

1. This file is auto-generated by Visual Studio's ASP.NET designer and should not be manually edited.
2. Changes to control definitions should be made through the Visual Studio designer or by editing the ASPX file directly.
3. This is a partial class definition; the main implementation logic for the page is contained in the accompanying code-behind file.
4. The OpportunityStages page is part of the CRM module's setup section and is used for configuring opportunity stages used in the sales pipeline process.
