# LeadSources.aspx.cs Documentation

## Overview

`LeadSources.aspx.cs` is a code-behind file for the `LeadSources.aspx` web form in the MixERP.Net CRM module. It's responsible for handling the server-side logic of the Lead Sources setup page. This page is part of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) module's setup section, where users can configure different sources from which leads can originate (e.g., website, referral, direct contact).

The file defines a partial class `LeadSources` that inherits from `MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass`, providing it with common functionality shared across pages in the MixERP application.

## Class Documentation

### LeadSources

**Namespace**: `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM.Setup`

**Type**: Partial Class

**Access Modifier**: Public

**Inheritance**: Inherits from `MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass`

**Purpose**: Provides server-side functionality for the Lead Sources setup page in the CRM module.

## Method Documentation

### Page_Load

**Access Modifier**: Protected

**Return Type**: void

**Parameters**:
- `sender` (object): The object that triggered the event.
- `e` (EventArgs): The event arguments associated with the event.

**Purpose**: Handles the page load event for the Lead Sources page.

**Functionality**: This method is triggered when the page loads. In the current implementation, it's empty, suggesting that there's no specific initialization logic required, and the page likely relies on the base class's default behavior or client-side scripts for its functionality.

**Example Usage**:
This method is automatically called by the ASP.NET page lifecycle when the page loads, so it doesn't need to be explicitly invoked:

```csharp
// This method is automatically called during page lifecycle
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Currently empty - no specific initialization logic
}
```

1. This is a minimal implementation relying on base class functionality from `MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass`.
2. The actual UI elements and client-side functionality would be defined in the corresponding ASPX file.
3. The page is part of the setup section of the CRM module, which provides configuration options for the CRM functionality.
