# OpportunityStages.aspx.cs Documentation

## Overview

`OpportunityStages.aspx.cs` is a code-behind file for the `OpportunityStages.aspx` web form in the MixERP.Net CRM module. It's part of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) setup section, specifically designed to manage the different stages that sales opportunities go through in a sales pipeline. This page allows users to view, add, edit, and manage opportunity stages in the MixERP system.

## Class Documentation

### OpportunityStages

- **Namespace**: `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM.Setup`
- **Inheritance**: Inherits from `MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass` 
- **Access Modifier**: `public`
- **Type**: Partial class
- **Purpose**: Provides server-side functionality for the OpportunityStages web form

## Method Documentation

### Page_Load

- **Access Modifier**: `protected`
- **Return Type**: `void`
- **Parameters**:
  - `sender` (System.Object): The source of the event
  - `e` (System.EventArgs): Event data associated with the Page_Load event
- **Purpose**: Handles the page load event for the OpportunityStages page
- **Implementation**: The method is currently empty, suggesting that the page may rely on the base class functionality or uses client-side scripting for much of its functionality.
- **Example Usage**: This method is automatically called by the ASP.NET framework when the page loads, and doesn't need to be explicitly called in code.

```csharp
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Custom initialization logic could be added here
}
```

## Dependencies

This file has dependencies on the following project components:

- Inherits from `MixERP.Net.BusinessLayer.BasePageClass`, which is likely defined in a separate assembly
- Related to [OpportunityStages.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/Setup/OpportunityStages.aspx.md) and [OpportunityStages.aspx.designer.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/Setup/OpportunityStages.aspx.designer.cs.md) which define the UI and control declarations respectively
- Has conceptual relationships with other CRM components such as [Lead.aspx.cs](../Lead.aspx.cs.md) and [Opportunity.aspx.cs](../Opportunity.aspx.cs.md)

## Related Files

The OpportunityStages functionality is part of the CRM module's setup section, which includes:

- [LeadSources.aspx.cs](LeadSources.aspx.cs.md): Manages sources of leads in the CRM system
- [LeadStatuses.aspx.cs](LeadStatuses.aspx.cs.md): Manages various statuses that leads can have

These setup pages work together to provide a complete configuration system for the CRM pipeline from leads to opportunities.

## Usage Notes

This page would typically be accessed from the CRM Setup section of MixERP and would provide a data grid or form interface for managing opportunity stages such as "Initial Contact", "Proposal", "Negotiation", and "Closed Won/Lost". While the code-behind file is minimal, the actual UI interactions would be defined in the associated ASPX file and possibly through JavaScript on the client side.
