# Index.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview

This file is an auto-generated designer code file for the `Index.aspx` page in the CRM module of MixERP.Net.FrontEnd. It defines the server-side controls that are declared in the associated ASPX file. Designer files are automatically maintained by Visual Studio and contain the declarations for controls that can be accessed programmatically in the code-behind file.

The file specifically defines a partial class `Index` that contains references to UI controls in the [Index.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/Index.aspx.md) page. This designer file works in conjunction with its code-behind file [Index.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/Index.aspx.cs.md), where the actual business logic is implemented.

## Class Documentation

### `Index` (partial class)

**Namespace:** `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM`
**Access Modifier:** `public`
**Purpose:** Provides programmatic access to the UI elements defined in the associated ASPX page.

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `MenuLiteral` | `System.Web.UI.WebControls.Literal` | A Literal control that likely contains HTML markup for a menu displayed on the CRM Index page. The control is protected with global scope, allowing it to be accessed from the code-behind file. |

## Notes

- This file is auto-generated by Visual Studio's designer tools and should not be manually edited.
- Any changes to control declarations should be made in the ASPX file or through the Visual Studio designer interface.
- The actual implementation of functionality related to these controls should be in the code-behind file [Index.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/Index.aspx.cs.md).
- The `MenuLiteral` control is likely used to render navigation or action menus specific to the CRM module.
