# Lead.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview
This file is an auto-generated designer class for the `Lead.aspx` web form in the MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM namespace. The file contains a partial class definition for the `Lead` class with declarations of UI controls that are defined in the corresponding ASPX page. This file is typically generated and maintained by Visual Studio's Web Forms designer and should not be manually modified as changes may be overwritten when the designer regenerates the code.

This file is part of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) module in the MixERP.Net.FrontEnd project, which provides functionality for managing leads in the system. It works in conjunction with the main code-behind file [Lead.aspx.cs](./Lead.aspx.cs) and the ASPX markup file [Lead.aspx](./Lead.aspx).
