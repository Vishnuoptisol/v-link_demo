# Opportunity.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview

This file is an auto-generated designer file for the `Opportunity` class in the MixERP.Net CRM module. It contains declarations for UI controls defined in the associated ASPX file [Opportunity.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/Opportunity.aspx.md). Designer files in ASP.NET are created and maintained by Visual Studio's designer tools and should not be manually edited as any changes will be overwritten when the designer regenerates the file.

## Class Documentation

### `Opportunity` Class

**Namespace:** `MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.CRM`

**Access Modifier:** `public partial`

**Purpose:** Represents the code-behind partial class for the Opportunity web form in the CRM module. This class provides programmatic access to the ASP.NET controls defined in the associated ASPX file.

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Access Modifier | Description |
|---------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| `Content1` | `System.Web.UI.WebControls.Content` | `protected` | Represents a content control that can be used in conjunction with a master page to define page-specific content. |

## Relationships

The `Opportunity` class is part of the CRM module in MixERP.Net and works in conjunction with the following files:

- [Opportunity.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/Opportunity.aspx.md) - The ASPX markup file that defines the visual elements of the opportunity page
- [Opportunity.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/CRM/Opportunity.aspx.cs.md) - The code-behind file that contains the business logic for the opportunity page

## Notes

1. This file is auto-generated by the ASP.NET designer tools and should not be manually edited.
2. The `partial` keyword indicates that the full class definition is split across multiple files (typically the designer file and the code-behind file).
3. The `Content1` control is likely used within a content placeholder defined in one of the master pages:
   - [ContentMaster.Master](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/ContentMaster.Master.md)
   - [MenuMaster.Master](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/MenuMaster.Master.md)
   - [MixERPMaster.Master](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/MixERPMaster.Master.md)
