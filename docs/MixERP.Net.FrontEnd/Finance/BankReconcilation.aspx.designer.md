# BankReconcilation.aspx.designer.cs Documentation

## Overview
This file contains the auto-generated designer code for the BankReconcilation web form in the MixERP.Net.FrontEnd.Finance namespace. It was created by Visual Studio's design-time tools and defines the UI controls declared in the associated [BankReconcilation.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Finance/BankReconcilation.aspx.md) file. Since this is an auto-generated file, it should not be modified directly as changes will be overwritten when the designer file is regenerated.

## Class Documentation

### BankReconcilation
```csharp
public partial class BankReconcilation
```

This is a partial class that represents the Bank Reconciliation page in the MixERP.Net system. It's defined as partial because the code is split between multiple files:
- The designer code (this file)
- The code-behind logic in [BankReconcilation.aspx.cs](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Finance/BankReconcilation.aspx.cs.md)
- The markup in [BankReconcilation.aspx](MixERP.Net.FrontEnd/Finance/BankReconcilation.aspx.md)

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Content1 | System.Web.UI.WebControls.Content | A content control that corresponds to a ContentPlaceHolder in the master page. This content control likely contains the main content of the bank reconciliation page. |

## Usage Context

The BankReconcilation page is part of the Finance module in the MixERP.Net system. It provides functionality for reconciling bank accounts, which typically involves matching the transactions in the accounting system with those on the bank statement.

This designer file serves as the connection between the ASP.NET markup and the C# code-behind, allowing the code-behind file to programmatically access and manipulate the UI controls defined in the markup.
