# VerificationModel.cs Documentation

## Overview

`VerificationModel.cs` defines the `VerificationModel` class that represents the verification information for transactions in the MixERP system. This model encapsulates details about who verified a transaction, when it was verified, and the reason for verification. It's part of the `MixERP.Net.Common.Models.Transactions` namespace and serves as a data structure for transaction verification operations across the application.

## Class Documentation

### VerificationModel

A public class that represents the verification information for transactions.

#### Access Modifier
- `public`

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Verification` | `short` | The verification status or code identifier |
| `VerifierUserId` | `int` | The unique identifier of the user who verified the transaction |
| `VerifierName` | `string` | The name of the user who verified the transaction |
| `VerifiedDate` | `DateTime` | The date and time when the transaction was verified |
| `VerificationReason` | `string` | The reason or comment provided for the verification |

## Related Components

This model is related to several other components in the MixERP system:

- Works alongside the [VerificationType.cs](VerificationType.md) enumeration, which likely defines the different types of verification statuses
- Used in conjunction with [VerificationDomain.cs](VerificationDomain.md), which may provide domain logic for verification operations
- Part of the transaction model ecosystem, which includes [TranactionMasterModel.cs](TranactionMasterModel.md) and [TransactionDetailModel.cs](TransactionDetailModel.md)
- Likely used by verification processes in the business layer, such as in transaction verification workflows

## Usage Examples

### Example: Creating a Verification Record

```csharp
// Create a new verification record
var verification = new VerificationModel
{
    Verification = 1, // Assuming 1 represents "Verified"
    VerifierUserId = 101,
    VerifierName = "John Doe",
    VerifiedDate = DateTime.Now,
    VerificationReason = "All documentation complete and accurate"
};
```

### Example: Using with Transaction Verification

```csharp
// Hypothetical example of using VerificationModel in a transaction verification process
public void VerifyTransaction(int transactionId, int userId, string reason)
{
    // Get user information
    var user = GetUserById(userId);
    
    // Create verification record
    var verification = new VerificationModel
    {
        Verification = (short)VerificationType.Approved,
        VerifierUserId = userId,
        VerifierName = user.FullName,
        VerifiedDate = DateTime.Now,
        VerificationReason = reason
    };
    
    // Apply verification to transaction
    ApplyVerificationToTransaction(transactionId, verification);
}
```

## Notes

- The `Verification` property is of type `short`, which suggests it may be used as an enum value or code that corresponds to specific verification statuses defined elsewhere in the system (likely in [VerificationType.cs](VerificationType.md)).
- This model appears to be designed for audit trail purposes, tracking who performed verification actions within the system.
- The model contains no business logic, following a proper separation of concerns design pattern.
