# ProductControlModel.cs Documentation

## Overview

This file defines the namespace `MixERP.Net.Common.Models.Core` in the MixERP.Net framework. The file is intended to contain model definitions for product control functionality, but currently it appears to be a placeholder or template with no concrete class implementations.

## Namespace Documentation

### MixERP.Net.Common.Models.Core

This namespace is likely intended to hold models related to core product control functionality within the MixERP system. While this specific file does not contain any class implementations, it establishes the namespace that would be used by other classes for organizing product-related models.

## Dependencies

The file imports the following .NET namespaces:
- `System`: Provides fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.
- `System.Collections.Generic`: Contains interfaces and classes that define generic collections, which allow users to create strongly typed collections that provide better type safety and performance than non-generic collections.
- `System.Linq`: Provides classes and interfaces that support queries that use Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).
- `System.Text`: Contains classes that represent ASCII and Unicode character encodings.

## Related Files

While this file is currently empty, it appears to be part of a larger model structure. Related files in the project include:

- [Menus.cs](./Menus.cs) - Another model in the same namespace that likely defines menu structures.
- [ProductModel.cs](../Transactions/ProductModel.md) - Possibly defines the basic product entity model.
- [ProductDetailsModel.cs](../Transactions/ProductDetailsModel.md) - May contain detailed information about products.

## Usage Context

Although this file is currently empty, it would typically be used to define classes that control product behavior or configuration within the MixERP system. Based on the project structure and naming conventions, it might eventually contain:

1. Product control settings or configurations
2. Classes for managing product validation rules
3. Models for product control workflows
4. Interfaces for product control functionality

## Development Notes

As the file currently contains only namespace definitions and imports but no class implementations, it appears to be in an early development stage or is a placeholder for future functionality.
