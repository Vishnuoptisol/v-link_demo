# Dialog Component Documentation

## Overview
The `dialog.tsx` file implements a reusable Dialog component based on Radix UI's Dialog primitive. This component provides a modal dialog interface that appears on top of the main content, allowing for focused user interactions without leaving the current page. The implementation includes various subcomponents for structuring dialog content including headers, footers, and descriptive elements, all with proper styling and animations.

## Dependencies
- React core functionality from React library
- Dialog primitives from Radix UI
- Icon components from Lucide React
- Utility functions from [utils.ts](../../lib/utils.md) for class name management

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { 
  Dialog, 
  DialogTrigger, 
  DialogContent, 
  DialogHeader, 
  DialogTitle, 
  DialogDescription, 
  DialogFooter
} from "@/components/ui/dialog";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export function DialogExample() {
  return (
    <Dialog>
      <DialogTrigger asChild>
        <Button variant="outline">Open Dialog</Button>
      </DialogTrigger>
      <DialogContent className="sm:max-w-md">
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Example Dialog</DialogTitle>
          <DialogDescription>
            This is an example of how to use the Dialog component.
          </DialogDescription>
        </DialogHeader>
        <div className="py-4">
          Content goes here...
        </div>
        <DialogFooter>
          <Button type="button">Save changes</Button>
        </DialogFooter>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. The component uses the `cn()` utility function from [utils.ts](../../lib/utils.md) to conditionally apply CSS classes.
2. All subcomponents are properly wrapped with `React.forwardRef` to ensure ref forwarding.
3. The component includes appropriate `displayName` properties for better debugging.
4. Animations are handled via Tailwind CSS classes with data attributes that respond to the dialog's state.
5. The dialog includes accessibility features like screen reader text for the close button.
6. The component is marked with `"use client"` directive, indicating it's meant to be used on the client side in a Next.js application.
