# Toaster Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Toaster.tsx` file defines a client-side React component that renders toast notifications in the application. It utilizes the toast context from a custom hook to display dynamic notifications with customizable titles, descriptions, and actions. This component serves as the main container for toast notifications throughout the application.

## Class Documentation

### `Toaster`
A React functional component that renders toast notifications using the application's toast system.

#### Attributes
- No explicit attributes, but it consumes the toast state from the `useToast` hook.

#### Access Modifier
- Public functional component exported for use throughout the application.

## Method Documentation

### `Toaster()`
The main component function that renders the toast notification system.

#### Access Modifier
- Public

#### Parameters
- None

#### Return Type
- JSX.Element - Returns the rendered toast notification container with any active toast notifications.

#### Implementation Details
1. Retrieves the current toast notifications from the `useToast` hook
2. Renders a `ToastProvider` component that wraps all toast notifications
3. Maps over each toast in the `toasts` array and renders a `Toast` component for each
4. For each toast, conditionally renders the title and description if they are provided
5. Appends any action elements passed to the toast
6. Adds a close button to each toast notification
7. Renders a `ToastViewport` component which defines the area where toasts appear

#### Example Usage
```tsx
// In a layout or page component
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      {children}
      <Toaster />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Dependencies
- The component utilizes the `useToast` hook from an external hook file (not in the project file list)
- It imports the following components from [`@/components/ui/toast.tsx`](./toast.md):
  - `Toast`: The individual toast notification component
  - `ToastClose`: A button to dismiss a toast
  - `ToastDescription`: Component for rendering the toast description
  - `ToastProvider`: Context provider for the toast system
  - `ToastTitle`: Component for rendering the toast title
  - `ToastViewport`: Defines the position and layout of the toast container

## Key Features
- Client-side only component (indicated by `"use client"` directive)
- Supports dynamic rendering of multiple toast notifications
- Each toast can have a title, description, and custom action
- Toasts can be dismissed via a close button
- All toasts are contained within a viewport that controls their positioning

## Related Components
The Toaster component is designed to work closely with the [`toast.tsx`](./toast.md) component, which provides the foundational toast UI elements and structure.
