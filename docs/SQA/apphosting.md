# apphosting.yaml Documentation

## Overview
The `apphosting.yaml` file contains configuration settings for Firebase App Hosting backend services. This configuration file defines how the application should be hosted and scaled within the Firebase infrastructure. It's a critical part of the deployment setup that works in conjunction with the [next.config.ts](next.config.ts.md) file to manage how the application is served.

## Configuration Documentation

### Firebase App Hosting Configuration

The file provides configuration options for managing the Firebase App Hosting backend services with references to the official Firebase documentation for detailed guidance.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `runConfig` | Object | Contains runtime configuration settings for the hosted application |

#### runConfig Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `maxInstances` | Integer | Defines the maximum number of instances that can be automatically provisioned to handle increased traffic | `1` |

## Usage Context

This configuration file works with the Firebase infrastructure to control how the application defined in [package.json](package.json.md) is deployed and scaled. The current configuration is set conservatively with only one maximum instance, which means the application won't automatically scale beyond a single instance regardless of traffic load.

## Related Configuration

The `apphosting.yaml` file typically works alongside:

- [next.config.ts](next.config.ts.md) - For Next.js specific deployment configurations
- [package.json](package.json.md) - Defines dependencies and scripts required for deployment

## Implementation Notes

1. The current `maxInstances` setting of 1 means the application won't automatically scale horizontally. This may be appropriate for development or testing environments but might need adjustment for production deployments with varying traffic loads.

2. Additional Firebase App Hosting configuration options could be added to this file as the application's needs evolve, such as environment variables, resource allocations, or region specifications.

3. For applications expecting higher traffic, consider increasing the `maxInstances` value to allow automatic scaling.
